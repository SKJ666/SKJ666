Hello There, I am Sebastian ^^ and this is README. 
<
I'm just a University student who passion is technology and design. In brief I can say that I am person who appreciates good using of minimalism and perfection in every aspect of life. Why? because correct use of minimalism is difficult and I think it needs some aesthetics sense of "taste" to make it looks felicitously and professional.
When I was in college one of my assignment was design and create a website, where I had to upload my all assignments. So it works like a portfolio and I remember that I've spend a lot of time just on design, thinking about which colour will be better for a header, which image I want to use and experimenting with effects and features. And I really enjoy it, I was really happy when I manage to add music player to my website. But I think that's enough for now I don't wanna take your time anymore I hope so you will have a good day. ^^
